When you run any of these codes, it'll open a finder so you can search by I18n keys or I18n translations. Pressing **ENTER** will open the file where that key or translation is defined, and pressing **CTRL+C** will copy the key.\n\n## Usage with Everything\nWith everything, things are simple: when you start to find anything with Everything plugin, after you type at least 6 characters, it'll try to match what you typed with a key or translation in I18n.\n\nThen, you can press **ENTER**, and it'll open the file which that key or translation was defined, or you can press **TAB** and it'll list a bunch of operations that you can do-including copying the I18n key to the clipboard.\n\n## Future\n\n* Try to autocomplete translations, finding each scope of current file or class\n* Automatically create new translations, putting then on the correct file (or creating a new one if it still doesn't exists yet)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mauricioszabo/atom-rails-i18n/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/mauricioszabo/atom-rails-i18n#readme","_id":"rails-i18n@0.1.3","_shasum":"ba750519c00dd9482b78097f875d67058abc1b43","_resolved":"file:../d-115111-5248-7s36wz/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115111-5248-7s36wz/package.tgz"}
