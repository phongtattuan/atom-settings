Define what is colorized. Every variable, function, class name, constant has a consistent color across all of your source.\n\n* Be as diverse as you want. Define how diverse your color scheme is with 8-360 colors used.\n* LESS Styles compiled from your base syntax colors for good consistent contrast against BG!\n* Customize the entities that is colorized\n\nFor JavaScript syntax to work properly you will need the language-javascript-semantic package since Atom does not properly parse JavaScript on it's own.\n\nSome features and ideas were taken from that package and applied globally, not just to JavaScript.\n\n# Notes\n\nThe settings supply the ability to configure the saturation levels that are used to generate the colors. If you are having contrast issues, or want to minimize/widen the range of colors used, you can manipulate these values. Sadly I do not have a decent way to describe the best way to go about getting your colors right without playing with the values... The relevant code used for generating the colors is below.\n\n```less\n.color-indices(@colorDiversity);\n\n.color-indices(@n, @i: 1) when (@i =< @n) {\n  @hue: @i * (360 / @n);\n  &.semanticolor-@{i} {\n    // Choose a color of the given hue with good contrast\n    color: contrast(@syntax-background-color,\n      hsl(@hue, @saturationLevelA1, @saturationLevelA2),\n      hsl(@hue, @saturationLevelB1, @saturationLevelB1)) !important;\n  }\n  .color-indices(@n, @i + 1);\n}\n```\n\n![A screenshot of semanticolor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xcezzz/semanticolor/master/screenshot.png)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","styleSheets":["semanticolor.atom-text-editor.less"],"dependencies":{"atom-space-pen-views":"~2.0.5","lodash":"^3.10.0"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/xcezzz/semanticolor/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/xcezzz/semanticolor#readme","_id":"semanticolor@0.2.2","_shasum":"56d204c38abc41a47704d8e299a2b20cc5e0980a","_resolved":"file:../d-115112-12804-lu4zhb/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115112-12804-lu4zhb/package.tgz"}
