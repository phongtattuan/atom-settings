The benefit of\nthis is that column select is no longer a two handed operation.\n\nTo work around an issue on linux where the contextMenu event is triggered on a mouseDown rather than mouseUp, I needed to suppress the contextMenu event, and then reissue it with a call to:\n\natom.contextMenu.showForEvent(e)\n\nThis has now been tested to work under both Windows and Linux, but I have no Mac available to test with.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/virtualthoughts/slickedit-select/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/virtualthoughts/slickedit-select","_id":"slickedit-select@1.6.0","dist":{"shasum":"ba0502005860b669f6ecc7d66ee2fd7ad52120b4"},"_shasum":"9c441c99a7c0a7d2e5ba6920852b02a95d2d576f","_resolved":"file:../d-115111-4315-1fbix5b/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115111-4315-1fbix5b/package.tgz"}
