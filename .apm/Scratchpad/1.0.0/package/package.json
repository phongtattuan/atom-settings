Use `ctrl-alt-,` to toggle the scratchpad. Scratchpad's\nheight and opacity can be overridden by adding the following to your config.cson file;\n\n```\n'scratchpad':\n  'rows': 15\n  'opacity': .75\n```\n\nIn this case, the minimum number of rows displayed is 15 and the Scratchpad is\nsightly transparent. Opacity must be a value between 0 and 1.\n\nScratchpad is simply an HTML textarea element, allowing it to easily be resized\nto your needs. Additionally, Scratchpad's is persistent, meaning notes will\nstay in Scratchpad until explicitly deleted.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/brianzable/Scratchpad/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/brianzable/Scratchpad#readme","_id":"Scratchpad@1.0.0","_shasum":"40f6026b628b6fcb2dcfc49c9997e0baf8ae08d6","_resolved":"file:../d-115111-3394-iu9bqm/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115111-3394-iu9bqm/package.tgz"}
