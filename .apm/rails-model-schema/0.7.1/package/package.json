It looks like this:\n\n![screencast](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platanus/atom-rails-model-schema/master/images/screencast.gif)\n\n## Usage\n\nIt's automatic when you open a ruby file with a class declaration. If you want to toggle the sidebar for some reason, you have to use the next keyboard shortcut:\n\n```\n⌃ + ⇧ + ⌘ + M\n(control + shift + command + m)\n```\n\nPlease create an issue if you want to suggest a better (more confortable) shortcut.\n\n## Current Drawbacks\n- For now, it only displays each attributes's name and type. (If you have an idea of how to show the `:limit`, `:default`, etc options of each column, make an issue with the idea)\n- It works by reading the class name of a ruby file, so if the model doesn't have the name of the table (for example, when setting the table name with `self.table_name=`), it won't work.\n\n## TODO\n- Make tests.\n- Fix the drawbacks listed above.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/platanus/atom-rails-model-schema/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/platanus/atom-rails-model-schema#readme","_id":"rails-model-schema@0.7.1","_shasum":"03236b70bf205a3e016623db6d4ffd1542120f52","_resolved":"file:../d-115111-4688-scmmks/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115111-4688-scmmks/package.tgz"}
