Open a project with a Gruntfile in the project root.\n 2. Open the task list (`ctrl-alt-g`) and choose a task to run, or input a new one.\n 3. The output from the grunt task will be shown in bottom toolbar. Toggle\n the log with `ctrl-alt-t`, toggle the entire toolbar with\n `ctrl-alt-shift-t`. The toolbar will appear automatically if Grunt Runner was able to find and\n parse a `Gruntfile`, otherwise you can toggle it on yourself.\n 4. If your task doesn't end automatically (e.g. watches files for changes) you\n can force it stop from the toolbar or by pressing `ctrl-alt-shift-g`.\n\n ## Notes\n 1. By default this package will try to use the the grunt module in your `[projectDir]/node_modules`\n directory. If for some reason that doesn't work, you can choose a path to look for the grunt module\n in by going to the settings. (e.g. `/usr/bin` or `~/path-to-global/node_modules`)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/nickclaw/atom-grunt-runner/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/nickclaw/atom-grunt-runner#readme","_id":"grunt-runner@0.11.0","_shasum":"0b81958cfe852254cc171f9a7debca614c4429a9","_resolved":"file:../d-115111-20562-1m7bl3n/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115111-20562-1m7bl3n/package.tgz"}
