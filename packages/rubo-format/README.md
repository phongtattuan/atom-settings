# rubo-format - gofmt like ruby code formatting in atom

This package is inspired by the way gofmt formats golang code. I wanted something similar for Ruby. This is a simple wrapper around `rubocop` which formats the current Ruby file on save.

Make sure you have `rubocop` installed.
`gem install rubocop`
