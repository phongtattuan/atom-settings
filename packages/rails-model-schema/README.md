# Rails Model Schema

A Atom package to show the schema of your [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) models when you open a file. It looks like this:

## Usage

It's automatic when you open a ruby file with a class declaration. If you want to toggle the sidebar for some reason, you have to use the next keyboard shortcut:

```
⌃ + ⇧ + ⌘ + M
(control + shift + command + m)
```

Please create an issue if you want to suggest a better (more confortable) shortcut.

## Current Drawbacks
- For now, it only displays each attributes's name and type. (If you have an idea of how to show the `:limit`, `:default`, etc options of each column, make an issue with the idea)
- It works by reading the class name of a ruby file, so if the model doesn't have the name of the table (for example, when setting the table name with `self.table_name=`), it won't work.

## TODO
- Make tests.
- Fix the drawbacks listed above.
